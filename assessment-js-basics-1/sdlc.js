// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// 1. Planning
// 2. Analysis of Requirements
// 3. Design
// 4. Implementation
// 5. Testing
// 6. Integration
// 7. Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "Second step, you want to define the requirements and figure out what the application or website you are working on is meant to do. Figure out all features they want to add and things that may be a conflict in the future."

const design = "Some of the aspects of design could include UI, Programming, Security, Communications, Architecture, and Platforms. This is were you can test out basic forms of the program to give the stakeholder information on what it may end up looking like. Also so they can see what the product may be capable of doing."

const implementation = "This is where you are going to be doing the programming. This step can be done by one or many programmers to work on the many parts of the program."

const testing = "Testing is a big part before it gets released to the user. That you test it many times to make sure you catch all the bugs you can before launch. There may have been many programers apart of the project doing different and small parts of it. Then it gets all put together and should make sure it all comes together to run well for the user."

const integration = "This step is where you are going to give access to the user to be able to use the product you have been building. This step can be manual or automated."

const maintain = "After people get access to the product. Costumers will discover bugs that still need to be fixed that may have been missed when working on the project."
